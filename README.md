# Compiler for lecture "Compiler Design"
My submission for the lab exercise of [Compiler Design Lecture at KIT](https://symbolaris.com/course/compiler.html).
Compiles L4 (similar to C0, a safe subset of C) into a x86_64 binary.

# Requirements
- Needs `gcc` to compile x86 assembly into an executable binary

# Current State
The lab is now over and the compiler is in a finished state.
It passed every test case and has very decent performace.
The compiler does some optimizations including dead code elimination and register allocation, yet there is still much room for improvement
... but i probably wont implement any of those because i got better things to do now
